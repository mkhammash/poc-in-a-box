# poc-in-a-box

## Overview
This repo is a collection of Kubernetes config (YAML), Prisma config (YAML) and Bash scripts. Its purpose is to facilitate a customer POV of the Prisma Cloud Network Security product on Kubernetes. Usually the POV will be ran on a public cloud managed Kubernetes service such as AWS EKS, Azure AKS, or GCP GKE. It is also possible to run on other implementations of Kubernetes as supported by the Prisma product. Normally your Prisma Account SE will assist you in the use of this repo. At the end of the POV you should have a fundamental understanding of the Prisma Cloud Network Security solution as documented in the objectives section.

## Details

### Prerequisite's
* A 'Prisma Cloud' account and corresponding Tenant ID
* A public cloud account (AWS, AZURE, GCP) or private cloud
* A Kubernetes cluster (EKS, AKS, GKE, OC4) and corresponding kubectl and config/credentials
* A Linux or Mac workstation
* Rudimetary understanding of the Bash shell and the ability to run basic commands
* Rudimetary understanding of Kubernetes and ability to run basic Kubernetes commands

You will need the value for TENANT, CLOUD and GROUP. TENANT is the name of your top level namespace and also your Prisma Tenant Account ID. CLOUD is the name of the namespace for the Cloud Account that has been on boarded and for which you will be working with. GROUP is the name of the namespace that corresponds to your Kubernetes cluster that we will be using as part of this POV. It is a best practice to name the GROUP namespace and your Kubernetes cluster the same.
| Variable | Value             |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| $TENANT  | |
| $CLOUD   | |
| $GROUP   | |

### Directories
The directory bin holds scripts and executables that will be used as part of the POV. The directory 'all' holds convenience scripts that will be documented later. The directories 'cloud', 'group', 'knoxville', 'memphis' and 'nashville' align with Prisma namespaces and we will refer to them collectively as "namespace directories". We will refer to the directories 'knoxville', 'memphis' and 'nashville' as the "apps". The namespace directories map to Prisma Cloud namespaces as follows:

| Directory | Prisma Namespace | Tag | Alias |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| cloud | /$TENANT/$CLOUD | @org:cloudaccount ||
| group | /$TENANT/$CLOUD/$GROUP | @org:tenant | K8S Cluster |
| nashville | /$TENANT/$CLOUD/$GROUP/nashville | @org:kubernetes | K8S Namespace |
| memphis | /$TENANT/$CLOUD/$GROUP/memphis | @org:kubernetes | K8S Namespace |
| knoxville | /$TENANT/$CLOUD/$GROUP/knoxville | @org:kubernetes | K8S Namespace |

Each directory contains one or more of the following:
* Kubernetes config in YAML format
* Prisma Network Security config in YAML format
* Scripts written in bash

The directories cloud and group hold Prisma Network Security config that will be applied to the cloud account and group (Kubernetes cluster). The app directories are each applications. Nashville and Memphis are virtually identical with the exception of their name. They contain a frontend and backend pod type. The backends form a cluster and the frontends talk to all of the backends. Frontends do not talk to each other. The backends for both also talk to the Nashville app database pod type. The Nashville app has only a single app type; the aforementioned database. The database pods create a cluster inside the Nashville app and accept incoming connections from Memphis and Knoxville backend pod types.

### Scripts
The namespace directories each contain a script named 'create' and 'delete'. The 'create' script is used to apply Kubernetes and/or Prisma configuration and the 'delete' script is used to remove said configuration. The app directories contain a script called 'attack' and 'shell'. The attack script will cause the app to attempt connections that it does not usually attempt. The shell script will give an interactive shell to a container within the app.
The directory 'all', like the namespace directories, has a script named 'create' and 'delete'. These are convenience scripts that will call the create or delete script in each of the aforementioned directories in the correct order. 

The order of 'create' is
1. Cloud
1. Group
1. App

The order of 'delete' is
1. App
1. Group
1. Cloud

The order of individual Apps is not of importance.

## Policy

Policy can be grouped into infrastructure, company policy and application. 

### Infrastructure
This is common services such as DNS and NTP. These are created once and then inherited. These may exist at different levels within the namespace. For example all workloads running a given cloud account may be authroized to talk the the local DNS server and workloads running in a given Kubernetes cluster may be able to talk to the local Kube DNS. Because the workloads are children of both the Kubernetes cluster and the Cloud they may talk to both DNS servers. But workloads in different Kubernetes clusters may not talk to Kube DNS running in other clusters. The same thing applies to workloads running in different cloud providers.

## Company Policy
These are policies based on company (or organization) policies. These are inherited and by children and can NOT be overridden. These are policies, for example, such as production may not talk to development. These are usually governed by the SecOps team. The SecOps team is advised to be careful with these policies as it requires the involvment of the SecOps team to modify these policies.

### Application
These are policies that govern the behaviour of an application for both intra-application and inter-application communication. These are usually under the control of the application team and stored in the CICD pipleline. When workloads running in the App need to communicate the App team may create policy to authorize these flows. The security control is the CICD pipeline (code reviews, etc). For inter-app communication both App teams must create a policy to permit the flow. Once again the security control is the CICD pipeline.

## Instructions

### Quick

1. Clone this repo
1. Change directory into the repo
1. Edit the file 'settings' and update TENANT, CLOUD, and GROUP
1. Source settings into your shell environment
1. Configure your Prisma App Creds
1. Run the script all/create
1. Once you are finished run the script all/delete

### Example
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aporeto-se/poc-in-a-box.git
cd poc-in-a-box
# edit the file settings
source env_shell
apoctl configure -n /$GROUP/$CLOUD -t $TOKEN
all/create
```

Whe finished
```bash
all/delete
```

## POV
Before starting the POV you should have poc-in-a-box up and running. We will be working from the Prisma Cloud console unless otherwise noted. We will also assume that you are working from "Network Security" and the namespace level is group (your Kubernetes cluster).
